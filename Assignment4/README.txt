This is the folder containing code for assignment4.
The file "assignment4_CNN.py" is the model that gave us the best accuracy. It can be run from the command line like normal
("python assignment4_CNN.py"), however the path to the images might have to be changed depending on where they are stored on the users local
computer.
The file "Assignment4_RFC.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook with the RFC model. It can be opened through Jupyter and contains documentation
and explanations.
The subdirectory CNN_models contain other CNN models we tried, where the suffix to the file name corresponds to the changes made relative
to the final model:
"_kernel" = changed kernel size
"_more" = more layers
"_less" = less layers
"_sigmoid" = sigmoid activation function
